## Basics of HTML & CSS -

In this project, I learned basic of html and css. How to write html code and follow semantic structure, loading of images on website, redirecting user when clicked in anchor element and many more stuff.

In css, I learned how to css code more effectively (write once and use multiple). Done with the basics of setting background, importing new font, how float actually works and many more.
